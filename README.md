# project-starlight
This project is a simple college hackathon search engine that allows users to search for hackathons and create their own hackathon list!

Users can search for hackathons based on criteria such as date, location, women's hackathons, and more! They can also prioritize these hackathons on their lists so that they can focus on the hackathons most important for them.

This was created using Java.
